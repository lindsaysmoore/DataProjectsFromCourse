# DataProjectsFromCourses
I did a few courses at Udemy that include Data Engineering, Machine Learning models from scikitlearn and building some neural networks with Tensorflow. Here I include the projects as i did them in the course, without any extra work. My main goal in doing these courses was to learn python for machine learning and to learn tensorflow, which has some very complicated setup. 

## Requirements:
I use Anaconda with Python 3 and the following packages:  
- tensorflow  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- numpy  

## Lending Club Data analysis - Random Forest:
This analysis is of data that can be downloaded from Lendingclub.com . Those data are too big for github, so I have included an engineered version of the data here that removed some features, combined some features and removed NAs. 
It was beyond the scope of the project to do further feature engineering, but I might go back later to do that because the results are not the best.  
### Data - loan_data.csv

## Time Series prediction with Tensorflow
This is the first project I did with tensorflow to predict 12 months in a timeseries.
